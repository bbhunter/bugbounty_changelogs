# bugbounty_changelogs

Newly released features mean new bugs right? I dorked changelogs / development progress tracking pages for >200 bug bounty programs (excluding VDPs), parsed them and created a list containing the most informative and constantly updating changelogs. If you have something to add, feel free to propose a pull request.
